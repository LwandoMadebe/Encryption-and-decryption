## 🔐 Simple Encryption & Decryption Tool
This Python project provides a simple yet effective way to encrypt and decrypt messages using a basic cipher. It ensures that sensitive data remains private by converting plaintext into unreadable ciphertext and back. Perfect for beginners learning about cryptography! 🚀

### 📌 Features
✅ Encrypts messages into unreadable format 🔒

✅ Decrypts messages back to original text 🔓

✅ Uses a simple shift (Caesar) cipher for learning purposes

### 🛠️ Installation

Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/LwandoMadebe/Encryption-and-decryption.git
cd Encryption-and-decryption
```

▶️ Usage
Run the script:
```sh
encryptanddecrypt.py
```

### 🛡️ Security Notice
This project uses a basic shift cipher (Caesar Cipher), which is not secure for real-world encryption. Consider using AES or RSA for strong encryptio
